**Project Summary – CMS Nursing Home COVID-19 Dashboard**

This project is a comprehensive data cleaning and analysis exercise using publicly available data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which tracks weekly COVID-19 statistics across U.S. nursing home facilities. The dataset includes critical metrics such as resident and staff vaccination rates, confirmed COVID-19 cases, and quality assurance check outcomes — all vital for monitoring healthcare facility compliance and pandemic control efforts.

**Objective:**
To transform a messy, inconsistent dataset into a clean, insight-driven Excel dashboard that can support public health decision-making, highlight facility-level performance, and expose the implications of data quality on reported outcomes.
Process Overview

**Data Acquisition:**
•	Sourced raw data from CMS Nursing Home COVID-19 reporting files
•	Total initial dataset: 14,791 rows (excluding headers), with state, facility, and vaccination data

**Data Cleaning:**
•	Performed deep cleaning using Power Query in Excel:
o	Removed records with missing federal provider numbers
o	Filtered out facilities that did not submit data or failed the Quality Assurance Check
o	Replaced or excluded abnormal provider IDs (e.g., 8-digit or invalid 6-digit codes)
o	Removed or handled columns with significant null values (e.g., resident weekly confirmed COVID cases)
o	Reformatted percentage columns and recalculated “recent %” fields to validate logic
o	Created a new column: “Provider State (Full Name)” for enhanced visualization
•	Final retained dataset: 62% of the original rows

**Data Quality Notes**
•	Facilities included were only those with valid submission status and QA approval
•	As a result, many vaccination-related metrics showed 100% compliance, signaling reporting bias introduced through QA-based filtering


**Dashboard and Visualizations:**
Created an interactive multi-page Excel dashboard that includes:
•	Top 20 States by:
o	Total COVID-19 cases
o	Staff vaccination rates
Resident vaccination rates
•	Facility-level view for exploring individual performance
•	Dynamic filters using PivotTables, Slicers, and Measures
•	Tooltips, data labels, and conditional formatting for clarity

**Key Calculated Measure Example:**
Vaccination Rate (%) = SUM(Number of Up to Date) / SUM(Number Eligible)

**Key Insights:**
•	Data completeness significantly affects the reliability of national trends
o	Only 66% of retained facilities passed the CMS QA check
•	Most retained facilities reported 100% vaccination — indicating strong compliance or denominator inconsistencies
•	State-level analysis reveals disproportionate case burdens, with variation in staff vaccination vs resident coverage
•	Filtering only QA-passed data may exclude facilities with greater risk or lower compliance — skewing insights toward “best performers”

**Tools & Skills Used:**
Tool / Skill	Use Case
Excel	- Dashboard development, data modelling
Power Query -	Data cleaning and transformation
PivotTables	- Aggregated reporting
DAX Measures -	Dynamic metric calculation
Data QA	Ensuring report integrity and reliability
	
**Limitations:**
•	Final analysis is based on QA-passed facilities only; may not reflect underperforming or non-compliant nursing homes.
•	Percentages near 100% should be interpreted in light of retained data only.
